# NFL-Betting-Project

This was a group project for my Database Management and Visual Analytics class (Fall 2019)

For our project we wanted to analyze how different factors impact the performances of football teams. These independent variables include weather, elevation, game type (e.g. playoffs vs. regular season), and whether the team was home or away. There are many different factors to consider. We also hoped to go beyond this point by looking into betting lines and their relationship with scores. For instance, our group examined how different weather factors impact the outcomes of NFL games. We looked at how total score, win/loss rates, and gambling implications were affected by weather. We also attempted to analyze how often the home team covers the spread over time. The following report will attempt to draw conclusions on which weather conditions impact games the most and look for money making opportunities in betting brought on by weather.
